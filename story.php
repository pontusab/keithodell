				<h1>A SINGLE RULE FOR WINE TASTING</h1>

					It was 2009, and I thought Yellow Tail produced a great wine. When it was up to me to choose wine for a party, I would instinctively pick up a bottle of their Shiraz/Cabernet blend, noting its “spicy, but floral” notes and recommending that everybody give it a try. It was always a hit with our small group of inexperienced wine-os, so why spend more than $7.99 when I could get a liter and a half of Yellow Tail for that price at the local grocer?
				</p>

				<p>	 
					That all changed in October, when my friend Ron and I decided to spend a weekend in the Santa Ynez valley, near Santa Barbara, CA, and recreate the famous trip taken by Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church in Sideways—a movie I hadn’t seen at the time, but because of Ron’s constant recitation of the line, made me wary of trying or liking any of the region’s “f***ing merlot.”
				</p>

				<p>	 
					Except it’s no joke. And you won’t have to enjoy it ironically. Their wines are amazing. Even for newbies like Ron and I, we could taste a huge difference in their then-small-batch productions (they’ve since expanded quite a bit). Every wine was full, rich and complex. Even varietals we disliked at other wineries were great at Foxen.
				</p>

				<p>	 
					So we bought a bottle and found a table on their patio to close out the day with the cheese we bought in Solvang, a vintage 2007 Foxen Pinot Noir, and some cigars.
				</p>

				<p>	 
					Instead of solving the world’s problems though, we talked honestly with one another about how we disagreed. We were candid. No punches were pulled. We got angry with one another, and we laughed. We said things that were hurtful to each other’s face and we eventually came to terms with where we were wrong about one another, and where the other person was right about a flaw that we were unable to see in ourselves.
				</p>

				<p>	 
					Wine tasting is an exercise in having an opinion, and letting others have theirs. It isn’t just something to sip on, it’s a conversation piece. Two people can have two extremely different views on the same wine—one person may declare it the greatest thing they’ve ever tasted (“Imma let you finish, but this 2007 Pinot Noir from the Santa Ynez region is the greatest varietal of all time.”), while the person next to them thinks it tastes like dirt.
